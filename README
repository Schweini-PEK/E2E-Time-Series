Notes: notes.pdf
Slides: slides.pdf
Quiz: (To be updated)
Homework: under "homework/", solutions and datasets are placed with respect to the problems

Improvements:
We introduced a network for time series forecasting, and made a stronger connection between the homework and the notes (e.g. the DTW part).
Also, we give a more detail but easy understanding explanation about why we are using these kinds of networks as well as what we are benefiting from deep learning. 
We fixed the typos and update some questions in the homework.
